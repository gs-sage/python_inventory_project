# part of my road to Software engineering projects

Creating a simple python inventory project
> 2025/03/06
> Started the project to build a simple inventory tracker that will let users, add, update, view, and remove items from a dictionary
> Starting as a CLI based program and plan to use APIs and database later with a GUI to make a simple app

v1.0:
>Added basic functionality to the program
>Users will be able to add, update, view and remove inventory items
>Added option to exit the program

v1.5(upcoming):
>Better error handling for invalid inputs
>Have the view inventory show the items in a table
